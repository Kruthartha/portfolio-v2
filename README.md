# Kruthartha S Gowda | Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built purely with HTML and CSS, to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information.

## Project Overview

This portfolio demonstrates my work as a fullstack developer. It includes:

- **Hero Section:** Highlights my name and provides clear call-to-action buttons.  
- **Projects Section:** Displays my projects in a responsive card-style layout with hover effects.  
- **Contact Section:** Grid layout with information on the left and a contact form on the right, optimized for desktop and mobile devices.  

The goal of this project was to create a clean, professional, and user-friendly web experience that reflects my design philosophy.

## Design Inspiration

I took inspiration from **Apple’s UI style** because:

- Apple emphasizes **clarity, simplicity, and elegance**, which aligns with my design vision.  
- Minimalistic layouts allow content to stand out without distractions.  
- Clean typography, ample white space, and subtle accent colors make the design visually appealing and easy to navigate.  

I personally enjoy **minimalist design** because it focuses on usability, reduces clutter, and ensures that the user’s attention is on what truly matters.
